      <p>
        I'm a versatile engineer on the East Coast of the United States. I've
        cultivated problem-solving skills since 2014 through various programming
        projects. My journey began with Matlab and has evolved into web
        development and beyond.
      </p>
      <p>
        Armed with a robust foundation in mechanical engineering and a growing
        expertise in software design principles, I'm eager to apply my
        analytical mindset and proven problem-solving skills to software
        engineering teams.
